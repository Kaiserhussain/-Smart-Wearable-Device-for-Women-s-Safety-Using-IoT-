Women face safety challenges daily in public spaces due to harassment and assaults. To address this, a smart safety wearable device using IoT is proposed. This compact device integrates a Arduino (Micro-Controller), Heartbeat sensor, Buzzer, GPS, Panic button. With the press of a button, records the victim’s location, and sends this information to emergency contacts or the police via the victim’s smartphone.
